# Summary

The Indonesian UD is converted from the content head version of the [universal
dependency treebank v2.0 (legacy)](https://github.com/ryanmcd/uni-dep-tb).


# Introduction

Lemmas, XPOS and morphological features added by MorphInd
(created by Septina Dian Larasati, run and converted by Dan Zeman,
http://septinalarasati.com/morphind/).

# Changelog

* 2021-05-15 v2.8

  * Initial release (Ryan McDonald).
